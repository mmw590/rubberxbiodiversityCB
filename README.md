# rubberxbiodiversityCB
This repository contains the R code used to perform the analysis in the following paper (in submission):

Wang M. M. H., L. R. Carrasco, D. P. Edwards. 2020. Reconciling rubber expansion with biodiversity conservation. *In submission.*


## About

A static version of the code and input data can be accessed at \[DOI: [10.5281/zenodo.1200255](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1200255)\]. The development version of this repository is available on GitHub at https://github.com/giovannistrona/oil-palm-primates.

Please refer to Key Resources Table in Methods of the article for where to download non-redistributable data.

Please run the code in the specified order.


## Note
The analysis largely followed the methodology of a previously published study by Strona et al. (2018), who provided their data and scripts  at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1200339. A development version of their respository is also available at https://github.com/giovannistrona/oil-palm-primates. (Primary language: Python)

**Figure 2.** Spatial overlay of rubber bioclimatic suitability with extinction vulnerability. Map of rubber bioclimatic suitability and extinction vulnerability along two colour scales, divided into four classes for rubber suitability and five classes for extinction vulnerability for plotting. The main plots show extinction vulnerability scores aggregated for threatened amphibians, birds, mammals and reptiles in Africa (A) and Asia and New Guinea (B). The subplots show extinction vulnerability scores for each taxonomic class separately. Protected areas are shaded in dark grey in the main plots.
