This repository contains the R code used to perform the analysis in the following paper (in submission):

Wang M. M. H., L. R. Carrasco, D. P. Edwards. 2020. Reconciling rubber expansion with biodiversity conservation. *In submission.*


## Instructions

A static version of the code and input data can be accessed at \[DOI: [10.5281/zenodo.1200255](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1200255)\]. The development version of this repository is available on GitHub at https://github.com/giovannistrona/oil-palm-primates.

Please refer to Key Resources Table in Methods of the article for where to download non-redistributable data.

Please run the code in the specified order.


## Note
The analysis largely followed the methodology of a previously published study by Strona et al. (2018), who provided their data and scripts  at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1200339. A development version of their respository is also available at https://github.com/giovannistrona/oil-palm-primates. (Primary language: Python)
